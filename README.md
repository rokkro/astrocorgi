 A S T R O C O R G I - mini game in java
 
To use: Add stdlib.jar to the project's libraries in your IDE. Run corgiMain.java
 
# Possible todo:
 1. Greatly improve difficulty selection difference. Vary number of balls, speed, etc. (time consuming)
 2. Make the win screen shinier (easy).
 3. Fix the corgi hitbox catching some balls near the corners when facing the wrong direction, if possible.
 4. Re-add audio files to game, if it doesn't cause lag.
