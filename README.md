# astrocorgi

If not using intelliJ, take the contents of src/ and put it in home - will fix if i return to this project in the future

A mini game in Java.
 
To use: Add stdlib.jar to the project's libraries in your IDE (such as intellij in this case), then run corgiMain.java.

Note: Fonts seem to show differently on Windows vs Linux. 
 
# Possible todo:
 1. Greatly improve difficulty selection difference. Vary number of balls, speed, etc. (time consuming)
 2. Make the win screen shinier (easy).
 3. Fix the corgi hitbox catching some balls near the corners when facing the wrong direction, if possible.
 4. Re-add audio files to game, if it doesn't cause lag.
 5. Improve oop setup/organization


Stdlib is from http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/ (You may want to mute your speakers when visiting).
