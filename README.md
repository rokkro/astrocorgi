 A S T R O C O R G I - A mini game in Java.
 
To use: Add stdlib.jar to the project's libraries in your IDE (such as intellij in this case), then run corgiMain.java.
 
# Possible todo:
 1. Greatly improve difficulty selection difference. Vary number of balls, speed, etc. (time consuming)
 2. Make the win screen shinier (easy).
 3. Fix the corgi hitbox catching some balls near the corners when facing the wrong direction, if possible.
 4. Re-add audio files to game, if it doesn't cause lag.


Stdlib is from http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/

You may want to mute your audio when visiting ^.
